// Create a Solana contract with a boilerplate hello world code that can be found here.
// Instead of processing just one instruction, create functions to calculate the sum and difference of two numbers.
// The corresponding functions should be called based on userâ€™s input.
// Final result should be stored in an account created by the program.

// Functionality:
// Solana contract with boilerplate hello world is created
// Function calculates the sum of two numbers chosen by user
// Function calculates the difference of two numbers chosen by user
// Final results are stored in an account created by the program

// Explanation:
// Demo and code read-aloud is submitted
// Demo and code read-aloud is complete (all steps explained)
// Demo and code read-aloud is clear and understandable
